            You probably give the wrong impression sometimes. People see you as cold, cruel, and intimidating. However, when people get to know you more, they find you very sweet. You really care about your friends and family. You are not easily provoked. However, when you lose your temper, you become reckless and cannot be contained easily. Montgomery Gator is a laid-back character who is proud of his bass-playing abilities and enjoys making people laugh. He is difficult to control once he loses his temper, but quickly regrets it. He would never want to hurt anyone. "Rock and Roll!"
